More responsive version of the original assignment.

I used flexbox for one section, grid was proving cumbersome.
Also designed menu overlay, not very smooth but works.
Somehow there were scrollbars popping up in divs especially with images, they went away with padding and overflow:hidden, will have to figure out a better way to deal with that 

I think I'll go ahead with bootstrap after this.
